# Delhi Metro Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Delhi Metro network using geographical and statistical data. The analysis includes the distribution of metro stations, the opening timeline, line-wise station count, and layout distribution.

## Dependencies
- Folium
- Plotly Express
- Plotly Graph Objects

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load the Delhi Metro network data.
   - Check for missing values and data types.

2. **Geographical Visualization:**
   - Create an interactive Folium map with colored markers for each metro station.
   - Colors represent different metro lines, providing a visual representation.

3. **Timeline Analysis:**
   - Convert the 'Opening Date' to datetime format.
   - Explore the number of stations opened each year using a bar chart.

4. **Line-wise Analysis:**
   - Calculate the total distance of each metro line and the average distance between stations.
   - Analyze the number of stations per metro line and the average distance.

5. **Station Layout Distribution:**
   - Examine the distribution of station layouts (elevated, underground, at-grade) using a bar chart.

## Results and Visualization
- **Geographical Map:**
  - An interactive map with colored markers indicating each metro station and its respective line.

- **Timeline Analysis:**
  - A bar chart showing the number of metro stations opened each year.

- **Line-wise Analysis:**
  - Subplots illustrating the number of stations per metro line and the average distance between stations.

- **Station Layout Distribution:**
  - A bar chart showcasing the distribution of different station layouts.

## Note
- Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed before running the analysis.
- The file path for the Delhi Metro network data should be correctly specified for successful execution.
